        <h1>VARIABLE LOGO</h1>
        <h2>extra 1</h2>
        <p>
          A friend of mine in GD made a variable logo for himself using processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he showed it to me I told him he should try making it in Glyphs 3 because it looked pretty straight forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          He said he had enough work on his plate as is, and didn't need any more.
        </p>
        <p>
          In trying to persuade him into giving it a try, I accidentally talked myself into wanting to make it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turned into a single glyph with 32 masters.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took a full day to make, but in the end it looks great, and he got me a nice bottle of white wine as payment.
