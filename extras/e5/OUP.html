          <h2>extra 5</h2>
          <p>Trying to create a color font.</p>

        <div>
          <p><i>If nothing shows up, open in safari.</i></p>
  
          <p>
            What shows up is the Apple color font version.<br>
            This is my third iteration, I started by making an SVG color font, and then I tried to make a layered color font.<br>
            Neither of them are ready yet because they had too much geometry (too many nodes in a single glyph) so I am currently working on simplifying it.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            This iteration on the right is a mishmash of two techniques:<br>
            This "font" is composed of two seperate layers; the <i>sbix</i> layer, with a PNG of the blason scaled and positioned over the "U."<br>
            And the regular vector glyph layer beneath it.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            The layers had to be exported as seperate fonts sadly.<br>
            So here in the HTML it's two text boxes, each with the seperate font layers, and both with the same positioning.

            I enjoy wine. I don't know much about wine though, so I just buy the wine with the best label.<br>
            A foolproof method to buying wine. It turns out to be great wine 99.8% of the time.<br>
            <a href="https://www.chateauderoquefort.com/en/gueule-de-loup">Gueule de Loup</a> was one such wine that passed my scrupulous selection process.<br>
            The golden blason placed on the simple type seemed like a fun challenge to attempt to replicate as a color font experiment.
