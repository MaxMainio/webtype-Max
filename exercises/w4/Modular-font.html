          Jesus wasn't broken, he was just bent, slowly cracking. Withering to only a fraction of what he was once, pain and despair taking full control of his life. Jesus the son of God, the big G, had been around for longer than he could remember. For many years he was content, until he met Jake and Logan Paul. He was completely taken falling right in love, this was the beginnin of his approaching sorrow.

          For awhile all was well, happy, blissful, better than Jesus ever thought life could be. He never expected the immense pain that was soon to hit him like the strike of a whip upon a poor boy's back. It happened at the Area 51 raid, Jake and Logan went despite Jesus' heavy protestations. The brothers were murdered before the raid as no one wanted their help. This sent Jesus into a spiral of coke, copious amounts of alcohol, and loneliness. Everything seemed grim and dark, until he met a beautiful man who turned his life around.

          Shrek

          It was a sad night when soulmates met. A night that could only be described as shades of grey. Clouds loomed in Jesus' heart, little did he know those clouds were soon to part and give way to the first ray of sunshine since the Paul brothers deaths. Jesus walked into a small bar. Most would call it dingy, but at the moment this was were Jesus called home. He sat down on a wobbly red bar and ordered the strongest drink he possibly could. He didn't care how it tasted, his only concern was temporary relief from the thunderstorm in his heart.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          He was downing his third drink when a man sat down next to him, Jesus didn't notice until he spoke. "Rough night?" the stranger asked. When Jesus looked up he was astounded at the man in front of him, human perfection. The mans beautiful green skin glowed under the poor lighting in the bar, his full lips quirked in a questioning smile. Jesus blushed, unable to control the red taking over his pale face. " The same as every night" Jesus said immediately regretting it. He didn't need to get this beautiful stranger caught up in his mess of an existence, it was hard to call it a life anymore. But the angelic creation wasn't bothered, he looked at Jesus with kind eyes that said "I understand."
        </h6>
        <h6>
          The two were silent, simply gazing into one another's eyes. " Your beautiful" blurted Jesus, turning the deepest red imaginable. The green man laughed, filling Jesus' stomach with butterflies, a small embarrassed grin spreading across his usually sorrowful, but beautiful features. "Name's Shrek" said the beautiful man, Jesus knew then he was in love.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          "My n-name is J-Jesus" Jesus stumbled on his words as he spoke clearly taken aback by Shrek's charm and grace.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          "Good to meet ya, I would ask to buy ye a drink, but you've seemed to have had enough." Shrek's comment wasn't meant to be mean or harmful, but for the first time in Jesus' long life he was truly ashamed at himself and what he was currently standing for. He saw no pity or disappointment in Shrek's eyes, just comfort and love. He felt safe in the presence of this stunning man. Jesus then noticed the amount of empty seats in the bar, Shrek hadn't needed to sit next to him, so maybe Shrek was attracted to him as well. " I guess I have had a few to many" Jesus said his voice breaking, Shrek could tell he was hurting.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          "We all have our lows, but we have our highs too" said Shrek wisely. If Jesus hadn't been in love before he was now. Jesus wanted to take the large man here and now, but would that take from the Pauls' memory? He hadn't felt this way since Jake and Logan, he hadn't ever expected to again in the first place. He wanted nothing more than to be inside of Shrek feeling his tight warmth around his large member. Those thoughts were wrong, but Jesus still felt his pants grow tight at the thought of Shrek naked, ready for him. Little did Jesus know, Shrek felt the same lust.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          "What do ye say we meet back up when your sober" Shrek asked lust, but care shining in his eyes. Just then Jesus realized how beautiful Shrek's eyes truly were, beautiful shades of green and brown. In each eye he saw a shimmering swamp mixed into the other colors in Shrek's eyes. Jesus decided that was his favorite part about Shrek, he also realized how well he could read Shrek by looking at his eyes. Sure everything about Shrek was beautiful, but his clear compassion and care couldn't be rivaled. Shrek and Jesus blushed as they switched numbers fully intending to meet back up down the road. Jesus noticed Shrek's blush was a purply red, that Jesus couldn't help but find adorable. Jesus felt a tinge of happiness, smiling to himself in relief. How long had it been since he smiled?
        </h6>
        <h6>
          It was three days later that Jesus finally got a text from Shrek, he wasn't counting or anything. The text was an invite to Shrek's home, Shrek hoped the invite wasn't to abrupt or strange. Shrek wasn't exactly sure what he wanted in this relationship anyways, as he was still torn up about a loved one he had also lost. That was why he approached Jesus in the first place, he had the look of someone who had experienced great loss, just like himself. Shrek had coped with his loss differently than Jesus, not with drink or drugs, but with sex. Somehow he felt differently about Jesus, which truthfully scared him. One part of him wanted Jesus to be a one night stand the other wanted love and comfort.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          When Jesus arrived he was instantly confused. Why would a literal being from Heaven live here? It was secluded, small, and frankly looked a little lonely. Right after such thoughts crept into Jesus' mind he felt a shock of guilt. It was Shrek's choice to live here and he had no right to judge, even if his house was on a literal swamp. After all despite being a swamp, to put it nicely, the house wasn't falling apart and seemed nice. Nice for as was already said was a swamp. On the other end Shrek felt an intense worry that Jesus would be unaccepting of his house and wouldn't want to stay. He was only partly right, nothing would deter Jesus from seeing Shrek again and he by no means planned on leaving.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          Shrek greeted Jesus at the door, wow, Jesus had almost forgotten how beautiful he was. Jesus blushed, god why was he doing that so often now. " Hey Shrek, it's pretty good to see you again, I was actually quite excited when you texted me. I mean I wasn't waiting to hear from you or anything..." Oh god was he rambling? Shrek smiled, a smile that made the tension ooze away, putting Jesus at a calm ease.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          "Come on in, welcome to my swamp." Shrek gleamed, clearly proud of his simple home. Jesus entered and found Shrek's swamp to look much more comforting on the inside. Jesus took in the simple, but chic surroundings and smiled. " Your swamp is lovely, I like it's elegance." Jesus said with honesty and kindness. Jesus found himself wondering what Shrek's bedroom might look like, before dismissing the thought, he wasn't completely sure if he was here for sex or a date after all. Maybe it could be both? He was still so confused on what he actually wanted. Dad help him.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          Jesus' eyes scanned the room, noticing that Shrek's table was set, and his stove was on. The kitchen had a savory aroma, Shrek was cooking something. Dinner? This must be a date! Jesus was so happy, but should he be? Didn't he want just a fling? Everyday he got more confused over his love brewing for his new found obsession. " I figured we could make this a little fancy, if you don't mind." Shrek motioned to the table set with daisies and a leather skin tablecloth. Jesus couldn't believe Shrek would go through the trouble to make Jesus feel special, he hadn't felt special in so long.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          Shrek motioned for Jesus to sit down, "Food should be ready soon, I made you my specialty." Shrek smiled bashfully, "I'm not the best cook, but I hope it's to ye's taste." Shrek could put mud on a plate and Jesus would still eat it gratefully. Of course Jesus didn't say that, "It smells wonderful, I'm quite happy you've done this for me." Jesus said picking at his nails and looking down, Shrek could tell Jesus was not used to people being kind to him. "You didn't have to do this for me, I don't really deserve such treatment." Jesus' confidence was so low, it was possible even Shrek's compassion could do nothing for him.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          Jesus looked back up at his green angel, who looked at him empathetically. He too, often felt a deep sinking sadness, maybe they could help each other together. " Really? I thought this was way to simple for someone as great as you." Shrek laughed kindly, Jesus blushed as Shrek's beautiful accent came through his laughter. " You shouldn't sell yourself short, after all, I don't let just anyone into my swamp." Shrek smirked and winked before walking over to the stove to check on the meal.
