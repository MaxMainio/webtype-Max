      <h1>about <i>Generative?</i> Poems</h1>
      <p>
        <i>Generative?</i> Poems is an ongoing experimental website that sources random poems from <a href="https://www.poemist.com/" target="_blank">Poemist</a> by utilizing the <a href="https://poemist.github.io/poemist-apidoc/" target="_blank">Poemist API</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each poem is seperated by sentance into individual drop-down menus, taking into consideration the poet's original use of punctuation and line breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the poem space above populates with text, the middle column here in the user input section will keep track of the poems that have been added. By clicking on the poem title, you can read the original poem in it's entirety, or, you can access the author's biography by clicking on their name. Hovering over the entries in the list will highlight where they appear in the poem space above.
      </p>
      <p>
        The buttons in the far right column allow you to interact with the poems above.
