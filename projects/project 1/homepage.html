          <p>
            Emojis, which infuse flat text with personality, are everywhere. More than 900 million emojis (without text) are sent on Facebook messenger every day. Half of Instagram comments contain emojis. On Twitter, the most used emoji is üòÇ Face With Tears of Joy, and one in five Tweets contains an emoji, up from one in 10 in 2014, according to Emojipedia.

            However, emojis aren‚Äôt just a part of our social media lexicon. They‚Äôve gone mainstream. The White House Council of Economic Advisors, for instance, released a report about millennial debt and education, sprinkling emojis throughout the report. In Slack, remote workforces are adding custom emojis to their conversations to help personalize communication in a dispersed environment.

            Further proving that emojis have successfully embedded themselves in pop culture is the fact that they have their very own day. Mark your calendars (preferably with the emoji that has a party hat and horn): July 17 is World Emoji Day. The reason? July 17 is the date that‚Äôs famously displayed on the üìÖ Calendar Emoji. (By the way, it‚Äôs not random. July 17 was the date that iCal for Mac was first announced at MacWorld Expo in 2002).

            Here, a look at how emojis emerged and how they‚Äôre evolving, plus some fun facts about these pictograms.

            Really, the concept of emojis isn‚Äôt all that new as cultures have used different forms of pictograms as a part of human expression for centuries. The ancient Egyptians, for example, used hieroglyphics to record their stories and history.
          </p>
          <p>
            The modern-day emoji can be loosely traced back to chatrooms in the 1990s, when primitive emojis were used in conversations, like : ) to signal a smile or ; ) to punctuate a joke or sarcastic jab.

            But designer Shigetaka Kurita is considered to be the founding father of today‚Äôs emojis. In 1999, NTT DOCOMO, a Japanese cell phone company, released a set of 176 emojis for mobile phones and pagers. Emoji is the blend of two Japanese words: picture and letter. (It's a mere coincidence that ‚Äúemoji‚Äù sounds like it was derived from the English word ‚Äúemotion). Kurita used Japanese graphic novels and Zapf Dingbats typeface as well as illustrations and pictograms to create the first emoji library. The pixelated designs that ultimately gave way to today‚Äôs expansive emoji database are on display at the Museum of Modern Art.

            In 2015, and for the first time ever, Oxford dictionary deemed an emoji its ‚ÄúWord of the Year.‚Äù The ‚ÄúFace with Tears of Joy‚Äù üòÇ emoji earned the title because it was the most frequently used emoji worldwide. In general, the dictionary noted, the word emoji saw a large increase in use that year.

            Today, more than 3,000 emojis exist, including 117 new emojis that were introduced in 2020. Some of the newest arrivals include a toothbrush, green bell pepper, people hugging, bubble tea, Transgender flag, a black cat, and more
